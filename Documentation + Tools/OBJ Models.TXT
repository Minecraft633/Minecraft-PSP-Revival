OBJ MODELS MUST BE MADE OF TRIANGLES, NOT QUADS.


For this example, the OBJ's name will be "Model".
Go to StatePlay or StatePlayCreative.

In the ".h" file add - "ObjModel* Model;"

(LoadTextures)
Model = new ObjModel();
Model ->LoadObj("Assets/Models/Model.obj");
Model ->Optimize();

(CleanUp)
delete Model;

(Draw)
mRender->Draw(Model);
